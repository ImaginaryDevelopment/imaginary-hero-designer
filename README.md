# Welcome to the new Mids' Reborn : Hero Designer Github!
## Backstory
The original _Mids' Hero/Villain Designer_ project was designed by _Mids_ in order to allow _City of Heroes_ players to efficiently plan their character's development. During the project's life cycle _Titan Network_ took over its development and kept the project updated until 2012 when the last _City of Heroes_ server shut down. The project had since been abandoned it seemed as no further development continued.

In early 2019 with the re-emergence of _City of Heroes_ thanks to the _Homecoming_ team, the project seemingly resurfaced under the name of _Pines Hero/Villain Designer_ (maintained by _Pine_) which contained several database updates for issue 25. A short while later another adaptation of the project emerged under the name of _Mids' Reborn_ (maintained by _Crytilis_) which contained several more fixes and database adjustments. In June/July of 2019, a new project had begun thanks to _Maslow_ who worked on cleaning up the internal code of the program itself and getting it into a manageable state. _Maslow_ later approached _Pine_ about co-development of the project and the two began to work on it side-by-side. In late July _Crytilis_ joined the project upon being approached by _Maslow_ after the two had talked back and forth since early June. It was then decided that production on each of their individual versions (_Pines Hero/Villain Designer_, and _Mids' Reborn_) would be stopped, and a new version created with a name agreed upon by all parties.

 

With all 3 working together in joint development, the project has been reborn once more! This time with a new name, some new features, and a new team!
